Binary version is distributed via tarballs that are generated using
the build.py script.

Instructions for setting up Linux Virtual Machines via VirtualBox

1. Download ISO image of the Linux distribution. The preferred version
is the oldest LTS Ubuntu Linux distribution that has not reached its
end of life. Note the GLIBC version (ldd --version).

2. Create the virtual machine.

3. Install the Guest Additions (larger screen size, etc).
  Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image ...

4. Add a shared folder (used to export the tarballs).
  Settings -> Shared Folders (automount: Yes; access: Full)

3. Install packages (see pkgs-ubuntu-12.04-amd64 for complete list).
  autoconf
  libtool
  git
  zlib1g-dev
  openssh-server

  Shouldn't need this since we build the compiler and Python.
  g++
  gfortran
  python-dev

4. Copy any CA certificates needed to access https and then update the list.

  Ubuntu:
    Copy certificates to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates and then run
    sudo update-ca-certificates.

  Fedora:
    Copy certificates (pem format) to /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors and then run
    sudo update-ca-trust.

Update Guest Additions after updating VM Linux kernels
  sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup

Command line interface to Oracle VirtualBox

  List virtual machines
    VBoxManage list vms

  List running virtual machines
    VBoxManage list runningvms

  Start virtual machine
    VBoxHeadless --startvm NAME
    VBoxManage startvm NAME --type=headless

  Shutdown virtual machine
    sudo shutdown -h now
    VBoxManage controlvm NAME poweroff (if shutdown doesn't work)
