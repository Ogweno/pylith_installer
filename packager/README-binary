Instructions for setting up Linux Virtual Machines via VirtualBox

1. Download ISO image of the Linux distribution. The preferred version
is the oldest LTS Ubuntu Linux distribution that has not reached its
end of life. Note the GLIBC version (ldd --version).

2. Create the virtual machine.

3. Install the Guest Additions (larger screen size, etc).
  Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image ...

4. Add a shared folder (used to export the tarballs).
  Settings -> Shared Folders (automount: Yes; access: Full)

3. Install packages (see pkgs-ubuntu-12.04-amd64 for complete list).
  autoconf
  libtool
  git
  g++
  gfortran
  python-dev
  zlib1g-dev

4. Copy any CA certificates needed to access https and then update the list.

  Ubuntu:
    Copy certificates to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates and then run
    sudo update-ca-certificates.

  Fedora:
    Copy certificates (pem format) to /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors and then run
    sudo update-ca-trust.
